Data: 31 anonymized variables that have numerical
values due PCA transformation applied to original
features
Model: Decision tree classifier as well ANN (MLP)
in jupyter Notebook
Libraries: sklearn for preprocessing and model
building and train_test_split, snapML
Evaluation: roc-accuracy
Accuracy: Both models of decision tree give same
accuracy, 96%, with the snap ML model being 6
times faster in training on the dataset. While the
MLP model gives an accuracy of 99.99%
