Comparative analysis of CNN (5 layers) and pre-trained
VGG16 and ResNet18.
Pytorch and Tensorflow for model development and training.
Image classification using these models to make accurate
melanoma detection (benign or malignant).
Performance evaluation based on ROC-AUC, accuracy,
training time for 1 epoch and computational requirement.
Highest accuracy (0.92) and AUC (0.98) with VGG16.
Efficient training with ResNet18 (accuracy: 0.90, AUC: 0.97)
